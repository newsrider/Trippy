1,Casablanca,"It’s impossible to say “Casablanca” without conjuring images of Rick and Ilse and so many people from across Europe waiting in its cafes in hopes of getting out, and Morocco’s largest city is indeed cosmopolitan, attracting people from around the world. Today, this colorful city on the Atlantic Ocean happily coexists in several worlds: Art Deco buildings from its French colonial past, in one quarter, contrast with traditional Islamic buildings (and one of the world’s largest mosques), in another. A young, hip populace shuttles between them. ","You might want to start your day with something sweet, perhaps at Patisserie Bennis Habous, a family-owned bakery that has operated since 1938. The ovens are across the street, so the workers are constantly toting trays of pastries. You might try the cornes de gazelles, horn-shaped pastries filled with almond paste, or any of the other traditional Moroccan delights.","Visit the magnificent Hassan II Grand Mosque, one of the few mosques that permit visits by non-Muslims. The Quran says that “the throne of God was built on the water,” and so is the mosque: Almost half of its area extends over the waters of the Atlantic, and part of the floor is glass so worshipers can kneel directly over the sea. At night, lasers from the minaret point toward Mecca. ","venture with a private driver and guide to see the Portuguese side of Morocco. The medinas of El Jadida and Azemmour exude the charm of yesteryear in a labyrinthine collection of narrow streets, beautiful buildings, gates to mysterious passageways and a mixture of Portuguese, Arab, Andalusian and Berber architecture. The Portuguese part of El Jadida, also called Mazagan, is a Unesco World Heritage site that houses an old cistern and church.","Hotel Kenzi Basma.
This four-star, recently renovated property in downtown Casablanca nestles between the architecture of the Art Deco neighborhood and the cosmopolitan business district. ","We recommend The Caliph's House: A Year in Casablanca by Tahir Shah. In the tradition of A Year in Provence and Under the Tuscan Sun, acclaimed English travel writer Tahir Shah shares a highly entertaining account of making an exotic dream come true. By turns hilarious and harrowing, here is the story of his family’s move from the gray skies of London to the sun-drenched city of Casablanca, where Islamic tradition and African folklore converge–and nothing is as easy as it seems. Would you like to read it on your Kindle?",9 p.m.,6 hours 50 minutes,8:50 a.m.
2,porto,"Porto is, of course, known for its wine. But whether you’re a fan of ruby or tawny port, you can discover why Porto is also known as Portugal’s best food city. In an itinerary inspired by The New York Times, experience the city’s culinary best.","Sample traditional Portuguese dishes like bolinho de bacalhau codfish and nata sweet pastry at generations-old taverns and local cafes. Stop at Caldeireiros, one of a handful of restaurants that recently appeared serving petiscos, the Portuguese version of tapas. Try the alheira de caça, a sausage made with white meats like rabbit and chicken, and served with garlicky spinach, or a pork loin sandwich, topped with melted local cheese.","Travel to the Vila Nova de Gaia neighborhood on the south bank of the Douro where traditionally all port wine had to be made and blended. Though the wines now can be made upriver, where the grapes are grown, “the lodges” of all the famous houses are still the heart of the port wine industry. A visit to one of the most prestigious, W.&J. Graham’s, established in 1820, allows you to taste some of the fortified wine that made Porto famous. ","The Douro Valley, also known as the Alto Douro Wine Region, is a Unesco World Heritage site that produces equal quantities of port and table wines. Whole hills are terraced to allow the vines to soak up the sun overlooking the Douro. Follow the river upstream from the river port of Regua, stopping at the Sandeman winery at Quinta do Seixo for a tour, tasting and more excellent views. Known mostly for its port, Sandeman, founded in 1790, also produces brandy, cognac, Madeira and sherry. Continue to the river port of Pinhão to see the glazed tiles of the railway station before heading north to the city of Vila Real. Here you can explore the Casa de Mateus, a Baroque masterpiece designed by the Italian architect Nicolau Nasoni, set in equally sumptuous gardens. The house famously features on the label of the well-known rosé wine. ","The Yeatman Hotel. 
This Relais & Châteaux hotel is on a hill on the south bank of the River Douro, giving every room breathtaking, panoramic views over the historic center of Porto.","For wine afficionados, we recommend Anne Fadiman's The Wine-Lover's Daughter. Fadiman examines—with all her characteristic wit and feeling—her relationship with her father, Clifton Fadiman, a renowned literary critic, editor, and radio host whose greatest love was wine. Wine is the spine of this touching memoir; the life and character of Fadiman’s father, along with her relationship with him and her own less ardent relationship with wine, are the flesh. The Wine Lover’s Daughter is a poignant exploration of love, ambition, class, family, and the pleasures of the palate by one of our finest essayists.",9:45 p.m. ,7 hours,9:45 a.m.
3,Galápagos,"Charles Darwin called the Galápagos Islands “a little world within itself.” In these equatorial islands, an almost primeval world awaits. Most creatures have never learned to fear humans, so you’ll get up close encounters of the best kind. ","In the heart of one of the most abundant marine ecosystems on the planet, it’s no wonder that the  majority of the entrees in the Galapagos are seafood based, including a diverse, flavorful mix of fish and shellfish including shrimp, oysters, lobster, squid, and octopus. Sides frequently include a variation of plantains or yucca, locally grown vegetables and a soup, accompanied by freshly squeezed juices, cocktails, or organic coffee that is grown right in the highlands of Santa Cruz and San Cristobal.","Fly to Baltra Island and your entry to Galápagos National Park. Darwin’s finches, Galápagos doves, blue-footed boobies, flightless cormorants, flamingos, gallinules and ducks are all some of the species that we may see, as well as pioneer and endemic vegetation. ","Take a cruise to Isabela Island, the largest island in the Galápagos, making up more than half of all the land in the archipelago. After breakfast, board small inflatable boats, called pangas, to explore Tintoreras, a group of islets accessible only by boat. Walk a trail to observe marine iguanas, sea lions and marine birds diving and fishing into the water from above. ","We recommend the Galaxy Cruise to tour the islands, but if you'd like to make a stopover, stay at Swissotel Quito in Quito, Ecuador, before starting your cruise. ","As you admire the finches on Darwin Island in the Galapagos, what better book to read than Charles Darwin's On The Origin of Species. Would you like to purchase the Audible version?",11:00 a.m.,6 hours 15 minutes,4:15 p.m. 
4,Tokyo,"Tokyo is more than 400 years old, and some people joke that many people there, are, too. But Tokyo is also the home of a huge youth culture that has been shaping the city in recent years the same way its history of earthquakes, fire, and war has done.","Dine like a local, at an izakaya. Izakaya are casual places where the locals typically stop for after-work drinks and food. Try many Japanese-style dishes such as tempura, boiled dishes, grilled seafood and more, over lively conversation and a glass of sake."," Take a panoramic city tour, seeing Tokyo landmarks like the iconic Tokyo Tower and the serene Asakusa Kannon Buddhist temple, with a photo stop outside the Imperial Palace. Continue to the Edo-Tokyo Museum for an in-depth, privately guided visit. The museum, housed in a unique building in the Ryogoku district, illustrates the past of Tokyo (which was known as Edo from its founding in the 1600s until 1869). ","If you stay in the Ginza, you can see the glamorous shopping area of Tokyo. But Japan, and Tokyo, is also the source of much of the world’s hippest fashion, which can be found in the busy
Harajuku district, where shops in Takeshita Dori cater to fashionable teens. Nearby, you can find European designer outlets like Dior and Louis Vuitton;  and Omotesando Hills, devoted to high-end fashion.","The Prince Sakura Tower Tokyo. Nestled among gardens and trees, this chic, contemporary hotel in southern Tokyo features air bubble baths in every room, a casual Italian cafe, a Japanese steakhouse and a sophisticated spa.","Kafka on the Shore by Japanese novelist and Tokyo local, Haruki Murakami. The New York Times rated it one of the best books of 2005, the year it's English translation was published. The Times reviewer wrote about the book, ""It is easier to be bewitched by Haruki Murakami's fiction than to figure out how he accomplishes the bewitchment.""",11:00 a.m.,13 hours 55 minutes,1:55 p.m.
